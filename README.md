YOO Day 1 of Javascript and i gotta say. AT THIS MOMENT, i absolutely do not like it.
Its like the logic i finally understood about Python is now being completely reversed with Javascript.
Id rather spend 300 more years doing Flask and SQL databases as opposed to learning more Javascript. 
Im Trying i really am, but man is Javascript so confusing. Ive never even read the code before this week. 
Will get it down at some point. Exposure is key im realizing.
